# FocusOnFutbol
Working repository for ball and controller code for ADI Project Playtime Focus on Futbol project

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ball_Code_V1 and Controller_Code_V1 are the programs for the project.

colors.h is no longer used, but contains RGB color definitions

BallTest_ControllerRadio_V1.ino is currently just an old copy of Controller_Code_V1, but is intended to test the controller radio communications without Nextion display input.

ESP32_Weather_Station is a project downloaded from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI-4_QyVenw as an example of using a Nextion display with an ESP32

The simple LED fading program is also included.
